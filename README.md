Question-
Even in today's world, we can only predict the arrival of a hurricane in advance but not an earthquake. we need to develop a techonlogy in order to predict earthquake days before as well.

Solution and Technology used-
In the website or the app we will give all the the info regarding earthquakes,where has it occurred what should people do at that time and further there will be various ways where people can post their problems and we can then help government to know where are people and it would consume less time...we know that this work is already done by media but it consumes a lot of time and A lot of people are unable to access government resourses at that time so our idea will be helpful in that...plus it will be free for everyone so people can use it without any hesitation...
